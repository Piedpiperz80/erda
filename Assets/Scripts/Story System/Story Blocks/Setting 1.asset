  storyText: 'The sky is thick with stars, sparse clouds dotting the inky black canvas
    like lost souls in the night searching for a way home. A crescent moon hangs
    low on the horizon, big and orange as a winter pumpkin. You''re walking down
    a dirt path that winds through tall grass, wheat fields rustling in the breeze
    to either side of you. '
