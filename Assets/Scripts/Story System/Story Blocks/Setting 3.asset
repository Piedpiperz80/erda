  storyText: It feels confusing and frightening not to know who you are or where
    you have come from. You feel like a lost child wandering in the dark, with no
    idea how to find your way home. Every step feels like it could be leading you
    further away from anything familiar and safe. Your mind is filled with questions
    - Who am I? What happened to me? Where am I supposed to go now? - but there are
    no answers forthcoming. All you can do is keep moving forward, hoping that eventually
    something will make sense again.
