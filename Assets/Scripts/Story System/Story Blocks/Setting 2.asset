  storyText: 'In front of you is a hill topped by a small village - perhaps a dozen
    houses clustered together around an unlit bonfire pit at its centre. There''s
    no sign of any people moving about; doors shut tight against night''s chill threats.
    Not even dogs bark as you approach cautiously from behind a line of wagon wheels
    propped up near what must be the main entrance to town.. '
